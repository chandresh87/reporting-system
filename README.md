# Reporting System

# Requirement

We have a table in an upstream database containing our employee labour costs. Our business want us to create a regular report summarising total costs per department. This report will be fed into the Firmâ€™s central accounting system to help give transparency to the business as to the true overhead of running the firm per department.

# Sample Data

|Employee ID   |Title  | Department  | Monthly Cost  | Currency  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 91847  | Associate  | Sales  |  500 | USD  |
| 10900  | Manager  | Sales  |  1200 | EUR  |
| 36197  | Senior Manager  | Sales  |300000   | JPY  |
| 91468  | Associate  | Administration  |500   | GBP  |
|  07397 |  Associate | Administration  |  700 | USD  |
|  42954 | Manager  | Administration  |  1000 |  USD |

# Reporting requirements

We need a process that on a daily basis, takes the data from the table and produces a grand total of current labour costs per department. It needs to produce an output file which will be delivered to a downstream accounting system. The file should contain one row per department, with each row having the department name and the total current labour costs for that department.

# Solution

## Technology Stack:

     1. Java
	 2. Spring Batch
	 3. MapStruct
 	 4. Gradle
     5. MYSQL

## Running Instruction:

	1. gradle clean build
	2. cd  \reporting-system\build\libs
	3. java -jar -Dremote.client.accessKey="" -Dbatch.datasource.password="" report-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	4. Hit GET http://localhost:8080/run/{baseCurrency}

## Explanation

We have used Spring Batch heavily to solve this problem. 

### Flow

External rest trigger starts the batch job. The job consist of a Master/partitioner step and a Follower/Worker Step.


```
public Step masterStep(PartitionHandler partitionHandler) {
    return stepBuilderFactory
        .get("partition-step")
        .partitioner("read-employee-data-step", partitioner)
        .partitionHandler(partitionHandler)
        .aggregator(stepExecutionAggregator)
        .build();
  }
```


* The Master step runs first which is configured with the custom database partitioner, a partition Handler & aggregator.
* Database partitioner calls a database to fetch the unique department name and set that in the execution context.

```
 public PartitionHandler partitionHandler(@Qualifier("readDatabaseStep") Step readDatabaseStep) {
    TaskExecutorPartitionHandler taskExecutorPartitionHandler = new TaskExecutorPartitionHandler();
    taskExecutorPartitionHandler.setTaskExecutor(taskExecutor);
    taskExecutorPartitionHandler.setStep(readDatabaseStep);
    taskExecutorPartitionHandler.setGridSize(databaseProperty.getMaxPoolSize());
    return taskExecutorPartitionHandler;
  }
```
* TaskExecutorPartitionHandler implementation of PartitionHandler has been used here.
* TaskExecutorPartitionHandler starts N number of threads and each thread runs 'read-employee-data-step' in parallel.

```
 public Step readDatabaseStep(@Value("${batch.chunkSize}") int chunkSize) {
    return this.stepBuilderFactory
        .get("read-employee-data-step")
        .<DepartmentDTO, DepartmentDataBO>chunk(chunkSize)
        .reader(employeeItemReader)
        .processor(compositeItemProcessor)
        .writer(departmentItemWriter)
        .build();
  }
```
* read-employee-data-step get the department name from the step context that's been passed by the TaskExecutorPartitionHandler.
* read-employee-data-step read the data for a particular department in small chunk from the database.

```
SELECT new com.cm.batch.report.repositories.DepartmentDTO(e.department, SUM(e.cost) , e.currency) FROM EmployeeEntity e group by  e.department, e.currency HAVING e.department = :deptName
```  
* Call the Remote currency service to get the currency conversion rate in the processor.
* This remote call is cached in memory.
* At the end of the read-employee-data-step, it writes data the sum of data for a given department in a step context.
* when all the partitioned steps get completed, Step Execution Aggregator has been called.
* Step Execution Aggregator iterate over the partitioned step context and create a list of ReportModel & set that in the job execution context.

```
public class ReportModel {
private String departmentName;
private BigDecimal totalCost;
private String baseCurrency;
}
```

* At the end job, Job listener has been called which fetches the list of ReportModel from Job execution context & pass that to the PDF generator.
* PDF generator creates a PDF file having department cost data.

# Further Improvement
 In place of TaskExecutorPartitionHandler, we can use MessageChannelPartitionHandler or a DeployerPartitionHandler.

MessageChannelPartitionHandler - It runs the worker step outside the master step and communicate via message channel.
DeployerPartitionHandler - Launches the worker on at the runtime.
